## Hey there, I'm Francisco

I'm a software engineer currently specializing in *front-end* web programming. I work mainly using *React* and its tooling but every now and then I allow myself to build something neat using pure HTML, CSS, and ES5

Right now I'm focusing my learning on back-end technologies, specifically NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB, and hope to build something that helps people in the future.
