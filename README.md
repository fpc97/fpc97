## Hey there, I'm Francisco

I'm a software engineer specialized in front-end web programming. I work mainly using React and its tooling *(such as Next.js)* but every now and then I build something neat using pure HTML, CSS, and ES5 :)

Right now I'm focusing my learning on back-end technologies, specifically NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.
